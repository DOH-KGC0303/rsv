Building DAG of jobs...
Relative file path './source-data/geolocation-rules.tsv' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	all
	2	csv_to_ndjson
	2	fetch_from_genbank
	2	transform
	7

Removing output files of failed job fetch_from_genbank since they might be corrupted:
data/b_genbank.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
